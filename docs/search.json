    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic ‚Äúworks,‚Äù in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You‚Äôll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you‚Äôll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be ‚Äúnoisey‚Äù when only averaging a few numbers, but should ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g.¬†50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader."
