## Introduction

Dean Karlan at Yale and John List at the University of Chicago conducted a field experiment to test the effectiveness of different fundraising letters. They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).

_to do: expand on the description of the experiment._

This project seeks to replicate their results.

### Balance Test 

## ✅ Randomization Check: Treatment vs. Control Group Balance

To test the integrity of the random assignment, we compared several background variables between treatment and control groups using t-tests.

### 🔍 Variables Tested:
- `mrm2`: Months since last donation  
- `years`: Years since first donation  
- `hpa`: Highest prior donation  
- `female`: Female indicator  
- `couple`: Couple indicator  

### 📈 Key Findings:
- No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between groups for any variable tested.
- For `mrm2`, both a **t-test** and a **linear regression** (`mrm2 ~ treatment`) produced the same result (p = 0.905), confirming the methods agree.

### 🧠 Why It Matters:
These tests confirm that the treatment and control groups were **statistically similar before the intervention** — supporting the internal validity of the experiment.  
This is the purpose of **Table 1** in the paper: to demonstrate that any differences in donation behavior can be attributed to the matching grant treatment, not pre-existing group differences.



## Experimental Results

### Charitable Contribution Made

First, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. 

## 📊 Response Rate by Treatment Group

We visualize whether being offered a matching donation affects the likelihood of donating. This barplot compares the donation response rate between the treatment and control groups.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data_path = "karlan_list_2007.dta"  # Replace with correct relative path if needed
df = pd.read_stata(data_path)

# Compute donation rate by treatment group
donation_rates = df.groupby("treatment")["gave"].mean().reset_index()
donation_rates["Group"] = donation_rates["treatment"].map({1: "Treatment", 0: "Control"})

# Plot the barplot
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.barplot(data=donation_rates, x="Group", y="gave", palette="Blues_d")
plt.ylabel("Proportion Donated")
plt.xlabel("Group")
